# Algorithm complexity.

Creating short tests in Java to test time taken to excute methods on arrays.
Includes; last, reverse, shuffle and sort.
Used in built methods (Collections) but will test and compare on algorithms I have created at a later point.
Recorded and graphed in 'Numbers'. This is included in the repo for viewing.
